3.2  Process of datasets (datasets_DTI/)
------
 We placed the useful data obtained from the raw data in the 'datasets_DTI/processed_data' folder and the final generated dataset and its features in the 'datasets_DTI/datasets' folder.

#### The detailed steps to obtain positive samples of the DrugBank dataset and positive and negative samples of the CPI dataset are as follows:
In `main_data.py`.<br>
（1）Run 'get_drugbank_dti()' to get known DTIs from the DrugBank dataset; run 'filter_drugbank_dti()' to filter the DrugBank dataset with the required drugs and proteins.<br>
（2）Run 'get_cpi()' to get all CPI activity data from the ChEMBL and BindingDB databases; run 'get_P_N()' to get positive and negative samples of the CPI dataset according to the threshold.<br>
（3）Run 'get_info()' to get PubChem compound info with unique Canonical SMILES (Molecular Weight < 1000) and UniProt protein info with unique sequences; run get_GO_PPI() to get human PPI data and protein-GO term data.<br>
（4）Run 'filter_cpi()' to filter the CPI dataset with the required drugs and proteins.<br>
（5）Run 'filter_cpi_with_bi_compound_protein()' to filter the CPI dataset by ensuring that each compound and protein is present in both positive and negative samples, and get the CPI-extra set for the SD, SP, and SDP tasks.<br>

#### The detailed steps to generate training, validation, and test sets for the DrugBank and CPI datasets are as follows:
（1）In `DTI_datasets_splict.py`, run 'get_DTI_P_N()' to select negative samples for DrugBank dataset, run 'splict_train_valid_test_DTI(type)' to get the training, validation, and testing sets for the SR, SD, SP, and SDP tasks on the DrugBank dataset.<br>
（2）In `CPI_datasets_splict.py`, run 'splict_train_valid_test_CPI(type)' to get the training, validation, and testing sets for the SR, SD, SP, and SDP tasks on the CPI dataset.<br>

3.3 Calculation of feature
------
### Calculation of GO term similarities
Run `cal_GO_sim.R` to calculate GO similarity values. (GO/GO_sim/)

### Calculation of molecular fingerprint and protein descriptor
（1）Run `cal_fingerprint.R` to calculate the PubChem fingerprint.(feature/)<br>
（2）Run `trans_to_fasta.R` to convert protein_seq_13816.csv to protein_13816.fasta, and then use the iLearnPlus to calculate the KSCTriad.(feature/)

Case Study
------
Under the case studies folder<br>
（1）Run `case studies.R` to view prediction scores of training sets and predict other scores, and get top 10 scores.（Predict_scores.csv, case studies/top10_socres）<br>
（2）Run `analysis_scores.R` to view the prediction scores of the DTIs of the latest versions of the DrugBank, KEGG and ChEMBL databases.(2024.1.6)<br>
（3）Run `analysis_top_candidate.R` to validate top 10 candidate DTIs across three databases.

Model Interpretation
------
（1）Under the feature folder, run `cal_feature_sims.R` to calculate PubChem fingerprint similarities and KSCTriad similarities.（Pubchem_sim_1520.csv and KSCTriad_sim_1771.csv）<br>
（2）Run `Get_network_similarity.py` to calculate the first-order neighbor Jaccard similarities in HNet-DrPD-P. （feature/Dr_D_P_one_order_similarities.csv）<br>
（3）Run `analysis_model_interpretation.py` to calculate the similarities in 'J. Model Interpretation'.
